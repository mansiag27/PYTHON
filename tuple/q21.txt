21)Write a Python program to replace last value of tuples in a list.
Sample list: [(10, 20, 40), (40, 50, 60), (70, 80, 90)]
Expected Output: [(10, 20, 100), (40, 50, 100), (70, 80, 100)]

solution--

t1=[(1,2,3),(4,5,6),(7,8,9)]
n=[(x[0],x[1],100)for x in t1]
print(n)

output--
[(1, 2, 100), (4, 5, 100), (7, 8, 100)]
